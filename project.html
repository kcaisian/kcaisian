        <p><br>I graduated high school two weeks ago. Two years ago, my aunt gifted me this book: <em>97 things to do before you finish high school</em>. I wanted to keep up with it, but after time, it got pushed aside to the bottom of the bookshelf. I struggle with a mean case of “out of sight, out of mind” so i forgot all about the book.
            As I’m writing this, it is June 12, the summer after high school and the summer before college. With an extra long summer coming my way, I was renewed with the energy to accomplish these tasks.
            <br><br><em><strong>Hopefully I finish.</strong></em><br><br>
